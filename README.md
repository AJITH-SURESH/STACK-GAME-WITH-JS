# STACK-GAME-WITH-JS

# Stacking Game

This repository contains the source code for a simple stacking game implemented using Three.js and Cannon.js libraries. The game involves stacking blocks on top of each other as accurately as possible.

## Game Overview

In this game, the player needs to stack blocks on top of each other. The blocks are spawned on a platform, and the player must place them precisely to prevent them from falling off the platform. The game ends if a block falls off the platform. 

## Features

- **Stacking Mechanism**: Blocks are stacked on top of each other, and the player needs to ensure they align properly.
- **Physics Simulation**: The game utilizes Cannon.js for physics simulation, making the blocks interact with each other realistically.
- **Autopilot Mode**: Players can enable autopilot mode, where the game automatically tries to stack the blocks with a certain precision.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the game interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic and Three.js/Cannon.js integration.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click or tap on the screen to stack blocks manually.
4. Press the 'R' key to restart the game at any time.

## Development Setup

If you wish to modify or extend the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Make changes to the `script.js` file to modify the game logic.
4. You can also adjust the styling by modifying the `style.css` file.
5. Test your changes locally by opening `index.html` in a web browser.
6. Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
